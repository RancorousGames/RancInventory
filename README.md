# Unreal Engine Plugin: Rancorous Inventory

![MK_Featured_1](github/banner.jpg)

## About

An Unreal Engine plugin that provides a Data-Driven Inventory & Items system based on FPrimaryAssetIds and the Asset Manager.

This is a fork of https://github.com/lucoiso/UEElementusInventory
I wanted to implement a number of changes:
* Rely much more heavily on gameplay tags for types, categories, ids etc.
* Sub-classes of the item data asset e.g. UsableItem instead of relying on generic custom property maps
* URancInventorySlotMapper which can map slot indexes to the underlying item indexes in the inventory allowing inventory management
